# argo-intern repo

This project centers around observational analysis of ocean turbulance by examining the vertical profiles of tracers sampled by the Argo program, namely temperature and salinity. During SUMMER 2022 we used a filtering approach to analyze temperature profiles in four geographic regions, and we will expand this analysis to include other tracers and a broader geographic region this academic year.

Deliverables from the SUMMER 2022 internship include:
